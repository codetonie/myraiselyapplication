                <p>I never miss the opportunity to relate and personalize my interaction with a customer and over the years I've noticed that I have the most fun when I get to educate and empower customers. I would be a good fit because I am aware that providing
                    a great customer experience is more than just answering a phone call or responding to an email.&nbsp; (positive energy begets positive energy)</p>

                <p>Raisely is taking the fear out of fundraising; they have re-engineered the process. No longer does one think of bake sales and cold calling. Now with the innovative platform Raisely provides, organizations can go from "idea" to "execution"
                    seamlessly. I would love to support this forward thinking team. </p>

                <p> SW Airlines is one of the companies that has been able to maintain great customer support by focusing on customer satisfaction. With policies that cater to customer needs, it's not surprising to see them make the list of top airlines.
                    They do not charge a fee to alter an existing flight and customers can travel with up to two bags free. When my sister's checked bag was damaged SW was able to replace it with a brand-new bag, on site. Since then, they have become
                    my top choice for travel. They have coupled their product with great policies and a positive culture allowing their customer support to never go unnoticed. </p>
